# NLP_kickstart_tutorial
Selected examples of NLP

In this mini-tutorial, I'll do some NLP using following Python packages:

-NLTK
-SpaCy
-Polyglot
-Voikko
-Turku NLP neural parser
-Gensim
-Flair
-Scikit-learn

(+ Numpy, Pandas and Pyplot)

There are three Notebooks: 
 PART 1 with preprocessing and classical topic classification using TF-IDF scaling
 PART 2 with simple word and document embeddings and LDA topic modeling 
 PART 3 with state-of-the art contextualized word and document embeddings and classification

The main emphasis is in Finnish language data. I'll use a toy dataset with 416 wikipedia texts from two broad topics (economy/money and health), which are included.
