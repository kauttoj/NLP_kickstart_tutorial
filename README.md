# NLP_kickstart_tutorial
Selected examples of NLP

In this mini-tutorial, I'll do some NLP using following Python packages:

-NLTK  
-SpaCy  
-Polyglot  
-Voikko  
-Turku NLP neural parser  
-Gensim  
-Flair  
-Scikit-learn  

(+ Numpy, Pandas and Pyplot)

There are three Notebooks:  
 PART 1 with preprocessing and classical topic classification using TF-IDF scaling  
 PART 2 with simple word and document embeddings and LDA topic modeling  
 PART 3 with state-of-the art contextualized word and document embeddings and classification  

The main emphasis is in Finnish language data, which is not supported only by few libraries and tools. I'll use a toy dataset with 416 wikipedia texts from two broad topics (economy/money and health). This data is included as raw and processed form.

Codes are tested and should work with Python 3.6+ with latest versions of packages (as today). In order to train Flair models, you need PyTorch with relatively good CUDA cabable GPU.

Some interesting packages that I might cover in PART 4 (some day):
-DeepPavlov (for chatbots)
-AllenNLP (large collections of algorithms/models)
